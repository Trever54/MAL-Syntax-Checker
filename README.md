# MAL-Syntax-Checker

Spring 2016

This program was written for my Principles of Programming course at MSU Denver during the Spring 2016 semester. It inputs a MAL program (in the form of a .mal file) for errors and outputs some results (as a .log file). The results contain any errors that it finds as well as suggestions in certain cases for how to fix those errors. The design and code implementation is completely mine as to meet the requirements for the assignment. The code is complete with Javadoc documentation.
